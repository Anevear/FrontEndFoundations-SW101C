Dependability
Being on time makes sure you play in the game. This is one of the most important skills for which employers search This is the first thing they ask for when calling Career Services

Positive Attitude
Having a positive attitude is like showing up to your team’s game ready to give it your best, excited and ready to go even if it’s going to be hard work or you don’t feel like it.

Teamwork
Teamwork is just like when you’re playing basketball or performing in your band. You help each other to achieve a goal, you make sure you do your part, you get on with everyone, and you respect your manager.

Communication
You have good communication skills if you can listen well, you don’t swear at work or have a bad attitude, you can ask for what you want clearly and you’re not afraid to ask if you don’t understand something.

Willingness to Learn
Willingness to learn is showing that you’re happy to learn new things and what you need to know to do your job. It also means that when, for example, your coach says that you need to work on your passes, or your kapa haka teacher says you need to improve your poi actions, you don’t get too upset, but take it calmly and try hard to do better. You can demonstate a willingness to learn by building a large portfolio of projects that stretches your newfound skills.

Resilience
Maybe you’ve worked really hard on that school project and got a bad grade and feel like giving up? Or your boss criticizes your work? Resilience is accepting that life does get hard at times and does change. It’s about being able to change, ask for help and keep going.
